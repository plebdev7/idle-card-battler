> **Note to Agents**: This file contains the "Soul" and high-level vision of the project. For *how* to work, see the **Operational Guide**.

## 1. The Vision
**"Slay the Spire meets an Idle Game, in a Wizard's Tower."**
We are building a game that respects the player's time (Idle) but rewards their intelligence (Deck Building & AI Programming).

## 2. Design Pillars
1.  **Strategic Idle**: The game plays itself, but the *setup* is where the game is played. If the player loses, it's because their deck or logic was flawed, not because they didn't click fast enough.
2.  **Progression is Knowledge**: We don't just upgrade numbers. We upgrade the *AI's intelligence* (Random -> Priority -> Logic).
3.  **Flavor First**: The "Dark Fantasy" theme isn't just a skin; it dictates mechanics. (e.g., "Sacrifice" mechanics for Necromancy).
4.  **Death is a Resource**: As a Roguelite, dying is part of the loop. It should feel like "cashing out" knowledge/currency, not just failure.

## 3. User Preferences
*   **Theme**: Dark Fantasy / Wizard Tower.
*   **Combat**: Single-point defense (Tower vs Swarm).
*   **Complexity**: High card variety, deep interactions.
*   **Dislikes**: "Bad RNG" that feels unfair. (Mitigate with Tutors, Cycling, Retain).

## 4. Anti-Goals (What we are NOT building)
*   **Clicker Game**: We are not building "Cookie Clicker". No mashing buttons.
*   **Twitch Reaction**: No mechanics should require split-second timing.
*   **Pay-to-Win Mechanics**: Even if we have "Gems", the design should focus on strategy, not monetization hooks.
